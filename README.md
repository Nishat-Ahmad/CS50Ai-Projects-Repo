## Projects

### 1. TicTacToe
A fully functional AI for playing Tic Tac Toe. The AI utilizes a minimax algorithm 
to ensure optimal play and either win or draw against any opponent.

**Highlights:**
- Implements game tree search.
- Evaluates all possible moves to make optimal decisions.

### 2. Degrees
Determines the degrees of separation between two individuals based on a dataset 
of connections. It finds the shortest path using breadth-first search.

**Highlights:**
- Real-world application in social network analysis.
- Efficient pathfinding algorithm.

### 3. Knights
A solution to the Knights and Knaves logic puzzle. The AI determines which characters 
are knights (who always tell the truth) and which are knaves (who always lie).

**Highlights:**
- Implements logical reasoning and deduction.
- Solves puzzles based on statements.

### 4. MineSweeper
An AI that plays Minesweeper intelligently by identifying safe moves and 
flagging mines using probability and logical inference.

**Highlights:**
- Combines logic and probabilistic reasoning.
- Handles edge cases and complex board states.

### 5. PageRank
An implementation of Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based 
on their importance in a network.

**Highlights:**
- Simulates link analysis on a directed graph.
- Demonstrates the power of iterative algorithms.

### 6. Heredity
Predicts the likelihood of inheriting specific traits using Bayesian networks.

**Highlights:**
- Utilizes probabilistic reasoning.
- Handles complex family trees and genetic conditions.

### 7. Crossword
An AI that solves crossword puzzles by filling in words based on constraints 
and word lists.

**Highlights:**
- Efficient constraint satisfaction problem solver.
- Applies backtracking and heuristics.

### 8. Nim
Plays the game of Nim optimally using reinforcement learning. The AI learns 
through training to make the best possible moves.

**Highlights:**
- Incorporates Q-learning.
- Adapts to gameplay over time.

### 9. Shopping
Uses machine learning to predict customer purchasing behavior based on 
various features.

**Highlights:**
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and analysis.
- Implements supervised learning models.

### 10. Traffic
An image recognizer built using OpenCV to classify road signs from the 
GTSRB dataset.

**Highlights:**
- Uses TensorFlow for building convolutional neural networks.
- Includes data augmentation and preprocessing steps.

### 11. Parser
A natural language parser that interprets sentences and generates 
syntactic structures.

**Highlights:**
- Applies context-free grammars.
- Useful in NLP applications.

### 12. Attention
Generates sentences with masked words using an attention mechanism, 
demonstrating the core concept of modern NLP models like Transformers.

**Highlights:**
- Implements basic attention mechanisms.
- Explores sentence completion and language modeling.
